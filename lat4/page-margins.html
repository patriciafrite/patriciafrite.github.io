      <p class="helvetica helvetica-light text text-desktop drop-caps">
        Page margins set the default territory your text occupies on the page.
        Because they determine the maximum width of the text block, page margins
        have the greatest effect on line length. (Point size also affects line
        length, though more finely.) As page margins increase, line length
        decreases, and vice versa.

        [Note: A gutter margin is extra space on the inner edge of a page, used
        to account for a binding. In a duplex (two-sided) document, the gutter
        margin will automatically alternate sides. ]

      <h3 class="futura futura-bold mb-0">In Print</h3>
      <p class="mt-0">
        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Most word processors default to page margins of one inch.
          On standard 8.5″ × 11″ paper, that produces a line length of 6.5″.
          That was fine for the monospaced fonts of the typewriter era, which
          used a lot of horizontal space. But for proportional fonts, they’re
          too small.
          <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;At 12 point, left and right page margins of 1.5-2.0″ will
          usually give you a comfortable line length. But don’t take that range
          as an absolute—focus on getting the number of characters per line into
          the right range (see line length). The smaller the point size, the
          larger the page margins will need to be, and vice versa.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h3 class="futura futura-bold mb-0">On The Web</h3>
      <p class="mt-0">
        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, web browsers had no concept of margins—text
          simply flowed from one edge of the window to the other. That wasn’t a
          huge problem at the time, because computer screens were much smaller.
          With the advent of CSS, web designers could use the margin and padding
          properties to create space between text and the edge of its containing
          block.
          <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the web has never shaken the edge-to-edge
          design idiom. Many of today’s websites still look like they were
          created by designers who got paid by the square inch. Just as it’s
          important in print to let go of typewriter habits, it’s important on
          the web to let go of the habits.
          <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve text legibility, web pages need big margins
          too. There isn’t one margin size that will work for all web pages, but
          the core advice is the same as on the printed page—focus on line
          length. As you do that, you’ll find your margins getting bigger. Don’t
          panic.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h3 class="futura futura-bold mb-0">Fear Of White Space</h3>
      <p class="mt-0">
        <span class="helvetica helvetica-regular italic text"
          >“But if I use bigger margins, won’t a lot of the page be empty?”
          Sure. Is that a problem?
        </span>
      </p>

      <p class="helvetica helvetica-light text-small italic text">
        [Note: In 1921, the U.S. government introduced both 8.5” × 11” and 8” ×
        10.5” as standard paper sizes. The smaller size caught on within U.S.
        government agencies; the larger, with everyone else. It wasn’t until
        1980 that the whole U.S. government finally settled on 8.5” × 11”. ]
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;The 8.5″ × 11″ paper size, and the sizes of computer
          screens, are standards imposed on us by history and tradition. They
          are arbitrary. They do not represent anyone’s idea of a convenient
          size for good typography. But with page margins, you can reshape them.
          As proof, consider a print example. Are there any publications that
          use 8.5″ × 11″ paper? Yes, it’s the approximate size of many
          magazines. But do any of those magazines run text in a single block on
          the page with one-inch margins? No—never. They use multiple-column
          layouts or find other ways to divide the page.
          <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;So, are there any publications that do run text in a
          single block on the page? Sure—books are usually set in a single
          column. But do you ever see a book printed on 8.5″ × 11″ paper?
          No—never. It would be too big for comfortable reading.
          <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;Professional typographers never use 8.5″ × 11″ paper with
          a 6.5″ line length. Neither should you. Whether you’re writing for
          print or the web, set your text according to the principles of good
          typography. The white space will take care of itself. The pleasure of
          reading an effectively designed document will soon outweigh the
          unfamiliarity of extra white space around the edges.
          <br /><br />

        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          - A gutter margin is extra space on one side of a printed page that
          accounts for a binding. In a duplex (two-sided) document, the gutter
          will automatically alternate sides.
        </span>
        <br /><br />

        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          - In a printed document, do your margins all have to be the same size?
          No. To fit more text on the page, reduce the top and bottom margins.
          Your line length will stay the same, but you’ll get more lines per
          page. To make the text block appear centered vertically, try making
          the bottom margin about a 0.25″ larger than the top margin. Otherwise,
          the text block can look like it’s sagging. Finally, there’s no rule
          that a text block has to be centered on the page horizontally. For an
          asymmetric layout, make the difference between the left and right
          margins at least 1″ to make the asymmetry obvious.

        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          - The best way to judge a layout is with your eyes, not with a
          calculator. But typographers have long enjoyed fiddling with layouts
          that incorporate specific mathematical ratios. Most famous among these
          is the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618: 1. For instance, if
          you set page margins of 2.23″ on all four sides of 8.5″ × 11″ paper,
          the proportions of your text block will be close to the golden ratio.

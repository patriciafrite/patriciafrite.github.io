      <h2 class="futura futura-medium">
        Mandatory for justified text; optional otherwise
      </h2>

      <p class="helvetica helvetica-light text drop-caps-2">
        Hyphenation is the automated process of breaking words between lines to
        create more consistency across a text block.In justified text,
        hyphenation is mandatory. In left-aligned text, hyphenation evens the
        irregular right edge of the text, called the rag. Hyphenation is
        optional for left-aligned text because the rag will still be somewhat
        irregular, even with hyphenation. Hyphenation doesn’t improve text
        legibility. In this case, consider turning it off.
      </p>

      <p class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
        As line length gets shorter, hyphenation becomes essential. Why? With
        hyphenation off, your word processor or web browser can only break lines
        at word spaces. As the lines get shorter, there are fewer words and
        hence fewer possible break points in each line, making awkward breaks
        more likely.
      </p>

      <p class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
        In word processors, you can exert rudimentary control over automatic
        hyphenation. If you’re curious, search your help file for “hyphenation
        options.” Over the years, I’ve never touched these, so I doubt you’ll
        need to either. The nonbreaking hyphen and the optional hyphen solve
        most hyphenation problems, and even those are pretty rare. In pro
        page-layout programs, you can exert a lot of control over automatic
        hyphenation (usually in conjunction with justification, so all the
        settings together are known as H&Js). In web browsers, you can exert
        almost no control over automatic hyphenation, so if you use CSS
        hyphenation, be prepared for some clunkers.
      </p>

      <p class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
        If you’re using a web content-management system like WordPress, an
        alternative hyphenation method is to use a plugin that puts soft hyphens
        (aka optional hyphens) in the text. Soft hyphens are well supported in
        web browsers, even browsers that don’t support CSS hyphenation (e.g.,
        desktop Chrome). This also allows somewhat more control over
        hyphenation. But it’s more work. If your project demands full
        justification, this might be worth it. Otherwise, probably not.

        The hyphen (-) is the smallest of these marks. It has three uses.

        <li class="futura futura-medium text">
          <span class="futura futura-bold">1.&nbsp;</span> A hyphen appears at
          the end of a line when a word breaks onto the next line. These hyphens
          are added and removed automatically by the automatic hyphenation in
          your word processor or web browser.

        <li class="futura futura-medium text">
          <span class="futura futura-bold">2.&nbsp;</span>Some multipart words
          are spelled with a hyphen (topsy-turvy, cost-effective, bric-a-brac).
          But a prefix is not typically followed with a hyphen (nonprofit, not
          non-profit).
        </li>
        <br />

        <li class="futura futura-medium text">
          <span class="futura futura-bold">3.&nbsp;</span> A hyphen is used in
          phrasal adjectives (listenersupported radio, dog-and-pony show,
          high-school grades) to ensure clarity. Nonprofessional writers often
          omit these hyphens. As a professional writer, you should not. For
          instance, consider the unhyphenated phrase five dollar bills. Is five
          the quantity of dollar bills, or are the bills each worth five
          dollars? As written, it suggests the former. If you mean the latter,
          then you’d write five-dollar bills.

        [Note: No hyphen is necessary in phrasal adjectives that begin with an
        adverb ending in -ly (it’s a closely held company, not a closely-held
        company). Nor is a hyphen necessary in multipart foreign terms or proper
        names used as adjectives (habeas corpus appeal on the Third Circuit
        docket, not habeascorpus appeal on the Third-Circuit docket).]

      <p class="helvetica helvetica-bold text">
        Dashes come in two sizes—the en dash and the em dash. The em dash (—) is
        typically about as wide as a capital H. The en dash (–) is about half as
        wide. En and em dashes are often approximated by typing two or three
        hyphens in a row (-- or --- ). Don’t do that—it’s another typewriter
        habit. Use real dashes.
      </p>

      <p class="futura futura-bold text">The en dash has two uses.</p>

      <ul class="list-style-none">
        <li class="futura futura-medium text">
          <span class="futura futura-bold">1.&nbsp;</span>It indicates a range
          of values (1880–1912, pages 330–39, Exhibits A–E). If you open with
          from, pair it with to instead of an en dash (from 1880 to 1912, not
          from 1880–1912).
        </li>
        <br />

        <li class="futura futura-medium text">
          <span class="futura futura-bold">2.&nbsp;</span>It denotes a
          connection or contrast between pairs of words (conservative–liberal

      </ul>

      <p class="helvetica helvetica-bold text">
        The em dash is used to make a break between parts of a sentence. Use it
        when a comma is too weak, but a colon, semicolon, or pair of parentheses
        is too strong. The em dash puts a nice pause in the text—and it is
        underused in professional writing.

          - Don’t use a slash ( / ) where an en dash is correct.
        </span>
        <br /><br />

        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          - Even though the en dash is used for joint authors (Sarbanes–Oxley
          Act), use a hyphen for compound names. If the son and daughter of
          Sarbanes and Oxley married, they’d be known as Mr. & Mrs.
          Sarbanes-Oxley (with a hyphen), not Mr. & Mrs. Sarbanes–Oxley (with an
          en dash).
        </span>
        <br /><br />

        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          - Em and en dashes are typically set flush against the surrounding
          text. Some fonts include a little white space around the em dash; some
          don’t. If your em dashes look like they’re being crushed—particularly
          if you’re setting type on screen—it’s fine to add word spaces before
          and after.
        </span>
        <br /><br />

        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          - An en dash makes an acceptable minus sign in spreadsheets or
          mathematical expressions.
        </span>
        <br /><br />

        <span class="helvetica helvetica-light text">
          - Em and en refer to units of typographic measurement, not to the
          letters M and N. (Yes, the homophony is confusing. To disambiguate,
          loud print shops referred to them as mutton and nut.) In a traditional
          metal font, the em was the vertical distance from the top of a piece
          of type to the bottom. The en was half the size of the em. Originally,
          the width of the em and en dashes corresponded to these units. In
          today’s digital fonts, they run narrower.

          - Fans of Robert Bringhurst’s book The Elements of Typographic Style
          (and I am among them—see bibliography) may know that he recommends
          using en dashes with spaces rather than em dashes. Perhaps this
          practice is common in Mr. Bringhurst’s native Canada. But in American
          typography, it’s not.
